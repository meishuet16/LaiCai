# RetainIQ v2 — Team Development & Commit Log

**Project:** Dormathon 2026 — RetainIQ v2<br>
**Purpose:** Give every team member a shared, truthful record of what changed in **every Git commit**.<br>
**Related documents:** `RetainIQ_v2_Complete_Requirements.md`, `AGENT.md`.

> **Team rule — mandatory:** **Every commit that changes project files must include an update to `TEAM_LOG.md` in that same commit.** This includes code, documentation, database migrations, model artifacts/configuration, dashboard work and agent-generated changes. A commit with only a log correction must still explain that correction.

## 1. How every member uses this log

1. Before committing, copy the **Commit Entry Template** below and insert a completed entry at the **top of Section 4**, newest first.
2. Write the date/time in **UTC (ISO 8601)**, actual member name or approved team handle, workstream, branch and intended commit subject.
3. State **what actually changed and why**, naming important files/API/schema contracts. “Fixed bugs” or “updated stuff” is not sufficient.
4. List the **tests/commands run and their real results**; if none, write `Not run` and why. Record any synthetic/demo-only inputs and evidence limitations.
5. Record known bugs/blockers, anything another teammate needs to know, and the next concrete task. Do **not** record secrets, credentials, customer PII or restricted datasets.
6. Stage the modified files **and this log together**. Check `git diff --cached --name-only` includes `TEAM_LOG.md` before `git commit`.
7. Commit. Do **not** require the new commit SHA inside the same commit, because the SHA does not exist until the commit is created. Use timestamp, author, branch and subject to identify the entry. A post-commit link/SHA may be added in a **later logged commit** if useful.
8. If several members edit the log simultaneously, keep all legitimate entries when resolving merge conflicts. Never overwrite someone else's work.

**Definition of a good log entry:** A different teammate can understand the change, run the appropriate verification and know whether any integration contract was affected.

## 2. Recommended commit subjects

Prefer informative messages using these prefixes:

| Prefix | Use for | Example subject (illustrative only) |
|---|---|---|
| `feat:` | New behavior | `feat: add tenant-scoped event ingestion` |
| `fix:` | Defect correction | `fix: exclude pending cancellations at cutoff` |
| `test:` | New/changed tests | `test: cover ROI zero-cost edge case` |
| `docs:` | Documentation | `docs: align prediction payload contract` |
| `refactor:` | Internal change without behavior change | `refactor: share snapshot cutoff validator` |
| `perf:` | Performance | `perf: batch daily feature refresh` |
| `chore:` | Maintenance, dependencies, migrations | `chore: add prediction feedback migration` |
| `revert:` | Revert | `revert: restore last approved model config` |

Examples are **templates, not claims that any of these commits happened**.

## 3. Commit entry template — copy into Section 4 each time

Copy the block below **for each commit** and replace every bracketed placeholder:

```markdown

### 2026-10-10T08:17:17Z — Member 1 / Data & Backend Engineer — Security and temporal integrity remediation

- **Workstream:** Part 1 / Data Foundation & Core Backend
- **Branch:** `member1`
- **Commit subject:** `fix: enforce source and temporal security boundaries`
- **Issue / task:** Remediate Member 1 source authorization, sensitive storage, subscription ownership, historical eligibility, and integration-health audit findings.
- **Files changed:** `README.md`, `TEAM_LOG.md`, `docs/MEMBER1_DATA_CONTRACT_COMPLIANCE.md`, `docs/MEMBER1_TO_MEMBER2_DATA_HANDOFF.md`, `migrations/002_authorized_services_and_subscription_owners.sql`, `retaniq/__main__.py`, `retaniq/api.py`, `retaniq/data_foundation.py`, `retaniq/importer.py`, `tests/test_data_foundation.py`
- **What changed:**
  - Limited integration reads, snapshots, eligible-account enumeration and replay to the integration source; account snapshots/enumeration now also require a canonical identity mapping from at least one authorized source. Added separately provisioned tenant/service/source/purpose/role grants for trusted internal multi-source reads.
  - Constrained feature and explanation values to numeric/boolean data and bounded categorical fields, restricted reliability reasons to stable safe codes, and added sensitive-value checks.
  - Added append-only subscription ownership claims and composite tenant/subscription/customer foreign keys. Same-tenant cross-customer claims fail before canonical event insertion; the projection no longer changes owners. Legacy conflicting owners stop migration rather than being guessed.
  - Made historical eligibility depend on dated, source-backed subscription events instead of the mutable undated `customers.account_status`. Added the role/purpose/source-scoped `GET /v1/admin/integrations` health read for operators/admins.
- **Why it changed:** The audit found cross-source customer probing, unbounded feature/explanation strings, mutable subscription ownership, retroactive account status effects, and no authorized tenant-level integration-health view.
- **Contract / database / API impact:** Migration 002 adds service-principal and subscription-owner tables and rebuilds dependent subscription/billing tables with ownership FKs. As-of read helpers accept a new service-principal type; account-specific reads require identity mappings from granted sources. `GET /v1/admin/integrations` is additive; existing integration health and prediction/label fields remain unchanged. Member 2 must use safe reason codes and an explicitly granted service principal for cross-source histories. No dashboard or Member 2/3 logic was added.
- **Tests / verification:**
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — **PASS** — 39 tests; fixtures are synthetic.
  - Focused source-scope, customer-mapping probe, feature/explanation safety, subscription-owner collision, historical status, operator-health, and schema-upgrade regression tests — **PASS** — 1 each.
  - `python -m compileall -q retaniq tests examples` — **PASS**.
  - `python -m examples.member2_as_of_history` — **PASS** — synthetic handoff only; no labels or probabilities.
  - `python -m retaniq --help` — **PASS** — CLI includes local service-principal provisioning.
  - `git diff --check` — **PASS** — no whitespace errors; Git reported LF/CRLF conversion notices.
  - No repository linter or type-checker configuration was found.
- **Data / model / ROI evidence:** Synthetic fixtures only. `DATASET_CARD.md` remains `NOT_READY`; no real historical data, genuine 7/14/30 labels, model readiness, or ROI evidence is claimed.
- **Known issues / blockers:** SQLite remains in use and does not satisfy the integrated PostgreSQL requirement. No production TLS, managed encryption, or external identity provider was verified. Account-level suspension/closure still lacks a dated source-backed lifecycle contract. Real-data and Member 2 training readiness remain blocked.
- **Next action / handoff:** Member 2 provisions a service principal with only the required source/purpose grants, uses the as-of APIs, and maps descriptive reliability text to stable reason codes. Member 4 may use the new operator health endpoint. Project owners still need to authorize a genuine historical dataset before training work.
- **Reviewer / pairing:** N/A

### 2026-10-10T07:41:34Z — Member 1 / Data & Backend Engineer — Real dataset gate and Member 2 handoff

- **Workstream:** Part 1 / Data Foundation & Core Backend
- **Branch:** feature/data-foundation
- **Commit subject:** feat(data): add evidence-backed dataset handoff
- **Issue / task:** Investigate the unresolved real historical dataset gate and complete the Member 1 → Member 2 data handoff.
- **Files changed:** DATASET_CARD.md, docs/MEMBER1_TO_MEMBER2_DATA_HANDOFF.md, docs/MEMBER1_DATA_CONTRACT_COMPLIANCE.md, docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-real-dataset-handoff.md, examples/__init__.py, examples/member2_as_of_history.py, tests/test_member2_handoff.py, TEAM_LOG.md
- **What changed:**
  - Compared publicly documented dataset candidates and their source terms. KKBox is technically closest, but terms were not accepted, project eligibility was not verified, and no participant-authorized files were obtained; static and synthetic alternatives do not satisfy the temporal subscription target.
  - Expanded the dataset card with per-candidate feasibility, acquisition results, unmeasured coverage, and the NOT_READY decision.
  - Added a temporary-SQLite synthetic example and test that use existing Member 1 APIs to load one eligible account at a point-in-time cutoff while excluding a later event.
  - Added Member 2 handoff and requirement-by-requirement compliance documents. No Member 2 implementation or canonical schema was changed.
- **Why it changed:** Member 2 cannot responsibly build or evaluate genuine 7/14/30-day outcomes until source authorization, dated lifecycle facts, source availability, and observation coverage are established.
- **Contract / database / API impact:** No schema or production API behavior change. The example exercises existing ingestion, identity mapping, eligibility and as-of query helpers. Compliance records that current storage remains SQLite and does not meet the integrated PostgreSQL requirement.
- **Tests / verification:**
  - python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_member2_handoff.py -v — PASS — 1 synthetic handoff test.
  - python -m examples.member2_as_of_history — PASS — one synthetic eligible account; post-cutoff usage absent; no label or probability.
  - python -m unittest discover -s tests -v — PASS — 32 tests; all data fixtures synthetic.
  - python -m compileall -q retaniq tests examples — PASS.
  - python -m retaniq --help — PASS.
  - git diff --check — PASS — no whitespace errors; Git emitted line-ending conversion notices for modified Markdown files.
  - Get-Command kaggle -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue and Python find_spec('kaggle') — no executable/package present. No dataset download was attempted.
- **Data / model / ROI evidence:** Zero real records imported; no source file was available for local coverage measurement. Synthetic engineering example only. No labels, model, predictive performance, or ROI evidence generated.
- **Known issues / blockers:** Real dataset authorization/access and source coverage remain unresolved; genuine 7/14/30 labels and training readiness are blocked. The local prototype uses SQLite rather than PostgreSQL.
- **Next action / handoff:** Project owner to confirm source permission and provide an authorized longitudinal dataset. Then inspect and measure the files before implementing a reviewed canonical adapter; Member 2 owns feature/label construction and model evaluation.
- **Reviewer / pairing:** N/A


### 2026-10-10T07:28:13Z — Member 1 / Data & Backend Engineer — Enforce point-in-time and purpose data contracts

- **Workstream:** Part 1 / Data Foundation & Core Backend
- **Branch:** `feature/data-foundation`
- **Commit subject:** `fix(data): enforce point-in-time and purpose data contracts`
- **Issue / task:** Close additional findings from the read-only review of the Member 1 data foundation.
- **Files changed:** `retaniq/data_foundation.py`, `tests/test_data_foundation.py`, `README.md`, `TEAM_LOG.md`
- **What changed:**
  - Rejected predictions whose source-availability cutoff is later than the prediction's `as_of` time.
  - Required `billing_valuation` scope to store financial valuation fields in feature snapshots and prediction explanations.
  - Rejected contact and credential values, sensitive key/value fragments, control characters and overlong text in reliability reasons.
- **Why it changed:** Review identified point-in-time leakage, financial data stored by retention-only integrations, and unsafe free-text reliability reasons; follow-up checks expanded contact and credential labels covered by sanitization.
- **Contract / database / API impact:** Prediction and snapshot write contracts are stricter; retention-only consumers can still store non-financial features and explainers. No schema change.
- **Tests / verification:**
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — PASS — 31 tests; synthetic fixtures only.
  - `python -m compileall -q retaniq tests` — PASS.
  - `python -m retaniq --help` — PASS.
  - `git diff --check` — PASS — only Git line-ending normalization notices.
- **Data / model / ROI evidence:** Synthetic engineering fixtures only. No real dataset, model, churn, or ROI evidence was used or generated; dataset gate remains `NOT_READY`.
- **Known issues / blockers:** The local prototype still uses SQLite without production encryption/TLS/deployment controls or a PostgreSQL adapter; authorized historical data remains unavailable.
- **Next action / handoff:** Member 2 may persist valuation-bearing features only through a principal with `billing_valuation`; prediction builders must use no source data later than the declared `as_of`.
- **Reviewer / pairing:** Read-only code review; PIT, purpose-gating, and reliability-reason findings corrected.

### 2026-10-10T07:16:26Z — Member 1 / Data & Backend Engineer — Enforce purpose and valuation contracts

- **Workstream:** Part 1 / Data Foundation & Core Backend
- **Branch:** `feature/data-foundation`
- **Commit subject:** `fix(data): enforce purpose and valuation contracts`
- **Issue / task:** Follow-up to the read-only review of the Member 1 data foundation commit
- **Files changed:** `retaniq/data_foundation.py`, `retaniq/api.py`, `retaniq/currency_codes.py`, `tests/test_data_foundation.py`, `README.md`, `TEAM_LOG.md`
- **What changed:**
  - Enforced purpose scopes on data reads and feature/label/prediction writes. Retention-only views preserve usage and billing status while redacting monetary fields; MRR and pricing fields require `billing_valuation`. Purpose failures return 403.
  - Required positive churn-label observation to cover the outcome time and validated linked feature snapshots against tenant/account/cutoff/version.
  - Bundled and enforced the official ISO 4217 List One code snapshot published 2026-09-17, excluding reserved test/no-currency codes.
- **Why it changed:** A read-only code review identified purpose-scope, outcome-coverage, snapshot-linkage, and currency-validation contract gaps.
- **Contract / database / API impact:** Read helpers now apply purpose-specific filtering. Part 2 can read lifecycle and usage data under `retention_inference` without seeing prices or MRR; Part 3 valuation requires both `retention_inference` and `billing_valuation`. No schema change.
- **Tests / verification:**
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — PASS — 31 tests; synthetic fixtures only.
  - `python -m compileall -q retaniq tests` — PASS.
  - `python -m retaniq --help` — PASS.
  - `git diff --check` — PASS — only Git line-ending normalization notices.
  - Bundled ISO code set compared with the SIX List One XML snapshot — PASS — exact match after excluding `XTS` and `XXX`.
- **Data / model / ROI evidence:** Synthetic engineering fixtures only. No real dataset, model, churn, or ROI evidence was used or generated; dataset gate remains `NOT_READY`.
- **Known issues / blockers:** The local prototype still uses SQLite without production encryption/TLS/deployment controls or a PostgreSQL adapter; authorized historical data remains unavailable.
- **Next action / handoff:** Member 2 can use retention-only reads without valuation fields. Member 3 needs an integration granted both retention and billing valuation. Refresh the bundled ISO list when SIX publishes a new List One snapshot.
- **Reviewer / pairing:** Read-only code review; four actionable findings corrected.

### 2026-10-10T07:05:21Z — Member 1 / Data & Backend Engineer — Tenant-scoped data foundation

- **Workstream:** Part 1 / Data Foundation & Core Backend
- **Branch:** `feature/data-foundation`
- **Commit subject:** `feat(data): add tenant-scoped canonical data foundation`
- **Issue / task:** Member 1 workstream from the supplied RetainIQ v2 requirements
- **Files changed:** `retaniq/data_foundation.py`, `retaniq/api.py`, `retaniq/importer.py`, `retaniq/__main__.py`, `retaniq/__init__.py`, `migrations/001_data_foundation.sql`, `tests/test_data_foundation.py`, `DATASET_CARD.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-data-foundation.md`, `TEAM_LOG.md`
- **What changed:**
  - Added tenant/source/purpose-scoped bearer authentication, explicit account identity mapping, allowlisted/minimized ingestion, safe error reporting, and idempotent event storage for usage, billing, and subscriptions.
  - Added append-only subscription history and availability-aware as-of access, silent-account eligibility enumeration, versioned minor-unit MRR, CSV import/replay, integration health, and shared feature/7/14/30 label/unified prediction storage contracts.
  - Added SQLite schema, API/CLI/data handoff documentation, and a dataset card that marks evidence `NOT_READY`.
- **Why it changed:** The checkout contained only a placeholder README and no backend, tests, migrations, or data. This supplies the Part 1 contract without duplicating Part 2 label/model logic or Part 3 decision rules.
- **Contract / database / API impact:** Added the SQLite migration and authenticated `POST /v1/ingest/events` / `GET /v1/integrations`. Tenant IDs come from authenticated server context. Canonical prediction storage keeps `prediction_id` separate from `prediction_run_id` and stores all three horizons in one row. Member 2 should use the documented as-of/account helpers; Member 3 should use the dated MRR/currency/status valuation. The migration is a local SQLite implementation, not a PostgreSQL deployment migration.
- **Tests / verification:**
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — PASS — 27 tests; synthetic fixtures only.
  - `python -m compileall -q retaniq tests` — PASS.
  - `python -m retaniq --help` — PASS.
  - `git diff --check` — PASS — no whitespace errors; Git reported only the README LF-to-CRLF normalization warning.
- **Data / model / ROI evidence:** Synthetic engineering fixtures only. No real dataset was present; no model, churn, or ROI evidence was generated. Dataset gate remains `NOT_READY`.
- **Known issues / blockers:** No authorized historical dataset/license, managed encrypted database, TLS termination, PostgreSQL adapter, external identity provider, or scheduled daily worker exists in this checkout. Currency validation checks three-uppercase-letter syntax, not full ISO registry membership.
- **Next action / handoff:** Member 2 can consume tenant-scoped point-in-time histories and the shared feature/label/prediction contracts. Member 3 can consume as-of MRR, currency, valuation time, and factual billing/usage references. The team must verify dataset provenance and provision production storage/security before real scoring.
- **Reviewer / pairing:** N/A

## 5. Team workstream directory — fill in before parallel development

| Workstream | Member / handle | Scope | Current handoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Part 1 — Data Foundation | _Unassigned_ | Historical import, Push API, data normalization, tenant/security, MRR | Canonical events and feature inputs |
| Part 2 — Prediction | _Unassigned_ | 7/14/30 labels, features, calibration, reliability and evaluation | Versioned `prediction_id` payload |
| Part 3 — Decisions | _Unassigned_ | Routing, action catalog, budget/capacity, human approvals | Case and human event history |
| Part 4 — Feedback & Dashboard | _Unassigned_ | Mature outcomes, evaluation, model governance, timeline, analytics | Feedback and manager dashboard |
| QA / Integration / Demo | _Unassigned_ | Cross-part contracts, replay, leakage/security tests, judge demo | Reproducible end-to-end proof |

Members may cover several workstreams. Update assignments through a logged commit.

## 6. Shared integration agreements — verify before changing

- **Prediction anchor:** `prediction_id` = unique account forecast snapshot; `prediction_run_id` = inference batch/job ID.
- **Forecast contract:** `p_churn_7d`, `p_churn_14d`, `p_churn_30d`, plus reliability, freshness, reserved uncertainty, versions and `as_of`.
- **Decision routes:** `PRIORITY_REVIEW`, `HUMAN_REVIEW`, `OBSERVE`; nonpredictive states `KNOWN_CANCELLATION`, `NOT_ELIGIBLE`.
- **Account:** paying subscription account, not each application seat. All customer-bearing tables are tenant-scoped.
- **Time truth:** both event occurrence and original data availability must be `<= as_of` before a feature is allowed.
- **Actual prediction labels:** 7/14/30-day matured source-backed outcomes; incomplete = unknown, not retained.
- **Action eligibility:** MVP-only actions must be backed by actual Part 1 fields; support/plan/discount actions remain disabled without their real prerequisite data.
- **ROI:** one-month break-even scenario, explicitly hypothetical; never claim retention uplift or saved revenue from observation alone.
- **Human authority:** no discretionary customer outreach or financial action without authorized approval.
- **Testing:** frozen chronological replay, no fake model predictions or benchmark numbers.

A teammate who changes any of these must update the canonical requirements/contract, the relevant implementation/tests, and their **same-commit log entry**, and inform downstream owners.

## 7. PR / merge checklist

- [ ] Every included commit has a meaningful **`TEAM_LOG.md` entry in the same commit**.
- [ ] Changed behavior and file paths are accurately summarized.
- [ ] Tests run (or not run with explanation) are recorded truthfully.
- [ ] Any altered schema/API/prediction contract is documented and downstream owners informed.
- [ ] No credential, private customer data, or secret was committed to code or log.
- [ ] Synthetic/demo numbers, cost assumptions and measured results are clearly distinguished.
- [ ] End-to-end time correctness, currency and tenant isolation are preserved.
- [ ] Another teammate can reproduce the change using instructions in the repo.

**Optional enforcement:** A repository owner may configure a Git pre-commit hook or CI rule that fails if a change commit does not stage/modify `TEAM_LOG.md`. Until then, the team must follow the rule manually.
