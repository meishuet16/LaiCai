# RetainIQ v2 — Team Development & Commit Log

**Project:** Dormathon 2026 — RetainIQ v2<br>
**Purpose:** Give every team member a shared, truthful record of what changed in **every Git commit**.<br>
**Related documents:** `RetainIQ_v2_Complete_Requirements.md`, `AGENT.md`.

> **Team rule — mandatory:** **Every commit that changes project files must include an update to `TEAM_LOG.md` in that same commit.** This includes code, documentation, database migrations, model artifacts/configuration, dashboard work and agent-generated changes. A commit with only a log correction must still explain that correction.

## 1. How every member uses this log

1. Before committing, copy the **Commit Entry Template** below and insert a completed entry at the **top of Section 4**, newest first.
2. Write the date/time in **UTC (ISO 8601)**, actual member name or approved team handle, workstream, branch and intended commit subject.
3. State **what actually changed and why**, naming important files/API/schema contracts. “Fixed bugs” or “updated stuff” is not sufficient.
4. List the **tests/commands run and their real results**; if none, write `Not run` and why. Record any synthetic/demo-only inputs and evidence limitations.
5. Record known bugs/blockers, anything another teammate needs to know, and the next concrete task. Do **not** record secrets, credentials, customer PII or restricted datasets.
6. Stage the modified files **and this log together**. Check `git diff --cached --name-only` includes `TEAM_LOG.md` before `git commit`.
7. Commit. Do **not** require the new commit SHA inside the same commit, because the SHA does not exist until the commit is created. Use timestamp, author, branch and subject to identify the entry. A post-commit link/SHA may be added in a **later logged commit** if useful.
8. If several members edit the log simultaneously, keep all legitimate entries when resolving merge conflicts. Never overwrite someone else's work.

**Definition of a good log entry:** A different teammate can understand the change, run the appropriate verification and know whether any integration contract was affected.

## 2. Recommended commit subjects

Prefer informative messages using these prefixes:

| Prefix | Use for | Example subject (illustrative only) |
|---|---|---|
| `feat:` | New behavior | `feat: add tenant-scoped event ingestion` |
| `fix:` | Defect correction | `fix: exclude pending cancellations at cutoff` |
| `test:` | New/changed tests | `test: cover ROI zero-cost edge case` |
| `docs:` | Documentation | `docs: align prediction payload contract` |
| `refactor:` | Internal change without behavior change | `refactor: share snapshot cutoff validator` |
| `perf:` | Performance | `perf: batch daily feature refresh` |
| `chore:` | Maintenance, dependencies, migrations | `chore: add prediction feedback migration` |
| `revert:` | Revert | `revert: restore last approved model config` |

Examples are **templates, not claims that any of these commits happened**.

## 3. Commit entry template — copy into Section 4 each time

Copy the block below **for each commit** and replace every bracketed placeholder:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ — [Member / Handle] — [Short change title]

- **Workstream:** Part [1/2/3/4] / Frontend / QA / Integration / Docs
- **Branch:** `[feature/branch]`
- **Commit subject:** `[type: clear summary]`
- **Issue / task:** `[ticket link or short task reference; N/A if none]`
- **Files changed:** `[specific paths or directories]`
- **What changed:**
  - `[Concrete implementation/change 1]`
  - `[Concrete implementation/change 2]`
- **Why it changed:** `[Problem, requirement, or bug addressed]`
- **Contract / database / API impact:** `[None, or describe fields/endpoints/migration and downstream owners notified]`
- **Tests / verification:**
  - `[command or manual check]` — `[PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN]` — `[details or reason]`
- **Data / model / ROI evidence:** `[Real / synthetic / configured assumption / N/A; actual source if appropriate]`
- **Known issues / blockers:** `[Specific risks, or None known]`
- **Next action / handoff:** `[Concrete follow-up and who owns it]`
- **Reviewer / pairing:** `[optional handle or N/A]`
```

**Small commit?** Keep the headings, use concise content, and put `N/A` where a field truly does not apply. Do not silently delete the test, impact, or blocker fields.

## 4. Commit history — newest first

<!--
Insert the first real commit entry DIRECTLY BELOW this comment, then keep
newer entries above older ones. No Git commits have been assumed or fabricated
in this initial template. When first committed, this documentation change
itself also requires a filled-in commit entry.

### 2026-10-10T07:05:21Z — Member 1 / Data & Backend Engineer — Tenant-scoped data foundation

- **Workstream:** Part 1 / Data Foundation & Core Backend
- **Branch:** `feature/data-foundation`
- **Commit subject:** `feat(data): add tenant-scoped canonical data foundation`
- **Issue / task:** Member 1 workstream from the supplied RetainIQ v2 requirements
- **Files changed:** `retaniq/data_foundation.py`, `retaniq/api.py`, `retaniq/importer.py`, `retaniq/__main__.py`, `retaniq/__init__.py`, `migrations/001_data_foundation.sql`, `tests/test_data_foundation.py`, `DATASET_CARD.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-data-foundation.md`, `TEAM_LOG.md`
- **What changed:**
  - Added tenant/source/purpose-scoped bearer authentication, explicit account identity mapping, allowlisted/minimized ingestion, safe error reporting, and idempotent event storage for usage, billing, and subscriptions.
  - Added append-only subscription history and availability-aware as-of access, silent-account eligibility enumeration, versioned minor-unit MRR, CSV import/replay, integration health, and shared feature/7/14/30 label/unified prediction storage contracts.
  - Added SQLite schema, API/CLI/data handoff documentation, and a dataset card that marks evidence `NOT_READY`.
- **Why it changed:** The checkout contained only a placeholder README and no backend, tests, migrations, or data. This supplies the Part 1 contract without duplicating Part 2 label/model logic or Part 3 decision rules.
- **Contract / database / API impact:** Added the SQLite migration and authenticated `POST /v1/ingest/events` / `GET /v1/integrations`. Tenant IDs come from authenticated server context. Canonical prediction storage keeps `prediction_id` separate from `prediction_run_id` and stores all three horizons in one row. Member 2 should use the documented as-of/account helpers; Member 3 should use the dated MRR/currency/status valuation. The migration is a local SQLite implementation, not a PostgreSQL deployment migration.
- **Tests / verification:**
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — PASS — 27 tests; synthetic fixtures only.
  - `python -m compileall -q retaniq tests` — PASS.
  - `python -m retaniq --help` — PASS.
  - `git diff --check` — PASS — no whitespace errors; Git reported only the README LF-to-CRLF normalization warning.
- **Data / model / ROI evidence:** Synthetic engineering fixtures only. No real dataset was present; no model, churn, or ROI evidence was generated. Dataset gate remains `NOT_READY`.
- **Known issues / blockers:** No authorized historical dataset/license, managed encrypted database, TLS termination, PostgreSQL adapter, external identity provider, or scheduled daily worker exists in this checkout. Currency validation checks three-uppercase-letter syntax, not full ISO registry membership.
- **Next action / handoff:** Member 2 can consume tenant-scoped point-in-time histories and the shared feature/label/prediction contracts. Member 3 can consume as-of MRR, currency, valuation time, and factual billing/usage references. The team must verify dataset provenance and provision production storage/security before real scoring.
- **Reviewer / pairing:** N/A

## 5. Team workstream directory — fill in before parallel development

| Workstream | Member / handle | Scope | Current handoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Part 1 — Data Foundation | _Unassigned_ | Historical import, Push API, data normalization, tenant/security, MRR | Canonical events and feature inputs |
| Part 2 — Prediction | _Unassigned_ | 7/14/30 labels, features, calibration, reliability and evaluation | Versioned `prediction_id` payload |
| Part 3 — Decisions | _Unassigned_ | Routing, action catalog, budget/capacity, human approvals | Case and human event history |
| Part 4 — Feedback & Dashboard | _Unassigned_ | Mature outcomes, evaluation, model governance, timeline, analytics | Feedback and manager dashboard |
| QA / Integration / Demo | _Unassigned_ | Cross-part contracts, replay, leakage/security tests, judge demo | Reproducible end-to-end proof |

Members may cover several workstreams. Update assignments through a logged commit.

## 6. Shared integration agreements — verify before changing

- **Prediction anchor:** `prediction_id` = unique account forecast snapshot; `prediction_run_id` = inference batch/job ID.
- **Forecast contract:** `p_churn_7d`, `p_churn_14d`, `p_churn_30d`, plus reliability, freshness, reserved uncertainty, versions and `as_of`.
- **Decision routes:** `PRIORITY_REVIEW`, `HUMAN_REVIEW`, `OBSERVE`; nonpredictive states `KNOWN_CANCELLATION`, `NOT_ELIGIBLE`.
- **Account:** paying subscription account, not each application seat. All customer-bearing tables are tenant-scoped.
- **Time truth:** both event occurrence and original data availability must be `<= as_of` before a feature is allowed.
- **Actual prediction labels:** 7/14/30-day matured source-backed outcomes; incomplete = unknown, not retained.
- **Action eligibility:** MVP-only actions must be backed by actual Part 1 fields; support/plan/discount actions remain disabled without their real prerequisite data.
- **ROI:** one-month break-even scenario, explicitly hypothetical; never claim retention uplift or saved revenue from observation alone.
- **Human authority:** no discretionary customer outreach or financial action without authorized approval.
- **Testing:** frozen chronological replay, no fake model predictions or benchmark numbers.

A teammate who changes any of these must update the canonical requirements/contract, the relevant implementation/tests, and their **same-commit log entry**, and inform downstream owners.

## 7. PR / merge checklist

- [ ] Every included commit has a meaningful **`TEAM_LOG.md` entry in the same commit**.
- [ ] Changed behavior and file paths are accurately summarized.
- [ ] Tests run (or not run with explanation) are recorded truthfully.
- [ ] Any altered schema/API/prediction contract is documented and downstream owners informed.
- [ ] No credential, private customer data, or secret was committed to code or log.
- [ ] Synthetic/demo numbers, cost assumptions and measured results are clearly distinguished.
- [ ] End-to-end time correctness, currency and tenant isolation are preserved.
- [ ] Another teammate can reproduce the change using instructions in the repo.

**Optional enforcement:** A repository owner may configure a Git pre-commit hook or CI rule that fails if a change commit does not stage/modify `TEAM_LOG.md`. Until then, the team must follow the rule manually.
